Overview:

The Smart Plant Care System is an Arduino-based project that allows users to monitor and maintain optimal conditions for different types of plants, ensuring their healthy growth and vitality. 
This repository contains the complete code and documentation for the system.

Features:

Plant Profiles: The system supports multiple plant profiles with specific ideal condition ranges for temperature, humidity, and soil moisture. 
Users can easily switch between profiles based on the plant they are cultivating.

Real-time Monitoring: The system employs a many sensors to continuously measure temperature, soil moisture and humidity levels. The data is displayed on the LCD for easy tracking.

Intuitive User Interface: A single button interface allows users to cycle through plant profiles and view current sensor readings on the LCD display, 
making it user-friendly and accessible to all.

Smart Notification: The system intelligently compares the real-time readings with the ideal condition ranges. If the conditions are not optimal for the selected plant profile, 
it displays specific messages on the LCD and an emoticon on the DOT matrix, indicating the need for corrective actions.
